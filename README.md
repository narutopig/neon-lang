# Neon

## A statically typed, functional, and interpreted language inspired by C

### About

- Neon is a programming language that I started when I was bored at school
- As stated above, Neon is meant to have a C-like syntax, but without any of the memory management magic that I can't seem to understand

### Roadmap

- Add more keywords (for, while, return, etc.)
- Make an interpreter that looks for a main function and runs it
- Accurate scope for variables and functions
- Classes
- Python transpiler
