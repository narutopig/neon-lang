# Neon

## A statically typed, not functional, and transpiled language inspired by C and Python

### About

- Neon is a programming language that I started when I was bored at school
- As stated above, Neon is meant to have a C-like syntax, but without any of the memory management magic that I can't seem to understand
  - However, Neon will have some syntactical similarities with Python, such as using def and elif

### Features

- Python transpilers (WIP)
- Top level variables (must be constant to prevent weird bugs)
- Memoized functions
- Limited scope for all functions

### Roadmap

- Classes
- Python transpiler
- Memoize all function calls by adding a comment
